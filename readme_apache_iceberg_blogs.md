## Getting Started

To run the notebooks and examples, you need [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker-archive/compose-cli/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

Start the environment:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This provides a complete Spark environment with Iceberg tables using MinIO as the storage backend.
